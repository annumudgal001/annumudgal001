# Hi, I'm Akshit Mudgal 👋  
#### 🧑‍💻 **Code Conjurer** | 🐍 **Backend Sorcerer** | 🎮 **Gaming Gladiator**

## 🚀 **About Me**  
🔥 **From the wraith of saints, I’m the demon** who writes code that even the compiler fears.  
🌱 Currently mastering **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) while crafting backends as robust as my sarcasm.  
💻 **C++ enthusiast** – because why write simple code when you can write *complicated* code?  
🎮 **Gaming addict** – debugging games when I’m not debugging my life.  
💡 Passionate about solving problems, breaking things, and then fixing them (*sometimes*).  
🚀 Always learning, always building, always breaking (intentionally or otherwise).
