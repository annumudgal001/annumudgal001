# Hi, I'm Akshit Mudgal 👋  
#### 🧑‍💻 **Code Conjurer** | 🐍 **Backend Sorcerer** | 🎮 **Gaming Gladiator**  

---

## **About Me**  
🔥 **From the wraith of saints, I’m the demon** who writes code that even the compiler fears.  

🌱 Currently mastering the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and building backend systems that are as robust as my sarcasm.  

💻 **C++ enthusiast** – because why write simple code when you can write *complicated* code?  

🎮 **Gaming addict** – I debug games when I’m not debugging my life.  

💡 Passionate about solving problems, breaking things, and then fixing them (sometimes).  

🚀 Always learning, always breaking, always building.
