### 🚀 **About Me**  
**Code Warrior** | **C++ Enthusiast** | **MERN Stack Developer**  

🔥 **“From the wraith of saints, I’m the demon who writes code that even the compiler fears.”**  
- I build backend systems that are as solid as my sarcasm.  
- Currently mastering the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) while diving deep into system design and C++.  
- **C++** is my love language because simplicity is overrated.  
- **Gaming addict** – when I’m not debugging code, I’m debugging games.  
- Always learning, breaking things (intentionally or not), and building scalable systems.
