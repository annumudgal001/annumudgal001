Hi, I'm Akshit Mudgal 👋
🧑‍💻 Code Conjurer | 🐍 Backend Sorcerer | 🎮 Gaming Gladiator
About Me
🔥 From the wraith of saints, I’m the demon who writes code that even the compiler fears.

🌱 Currently mastering the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and building backend systems that are as robust as my sarcasm.

💻 C++ enthusiast – because why write simple code when you can write complicated code?

🎮 Gaming addict – I debug games when I’m not debugging my life.

💡 Passionate about solving problems, breaking things, and then fixing them (sometimes).

🚀 Always learning, always breaking, always building.

🛠️ Node.js | Express.js | MongoDB | REST APIs

🛠️ Open Source: Eager to contribute to projects that are as ambitious as my coffee consumption.

🚀 Innovation: Passionate about building scalable, efficient, and slightly over-engineered systems.

Fun Facts
😄 Pronouns: He/Him (but my code is gender-neutral).

⚡ Fun Fact: I can debug code faster than you can say "undefined is not a function."

🎮 Gaming Philosophy: If it’s not lagging, you’re not trying hard enough.

☕ Fuel: Runs on caffeine, sarcasm, and the occasional existential crisis.
